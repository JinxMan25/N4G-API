As such, you may experience some irregularities. </em></p> <p><strong>Update: Phil Fish’s personal twitter has now been deleted, by him.</strong></p> <p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-22796" src="http://levelsave.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/philfishthing-236x300.png" alt="philfishthing" width="236">Phil Fish, every gamers favorite person to hate on, has just been hacked by the /v/ board over at 4chan. Following an extremely thorough doxxing by the volatile group, Polytron Corporation’s <a href="http://levelsave.com/phil-fish-polytron-doxxed-phil-fish-quits-gaming-sells-fez-polytron/polytroncorporation.com" target="_blank">website</a> and <a href="http://levelsave.com/phil-fish-polytron-doxxed-phil-fish-quits-gaming-sells-fez-polytron/twitter.com/polytron" target="_blank">twitter account</a> have been taken over by the internet radicals. The terrorists over at /v/ (specifically the  “head mod and leader of 4chan.org and Anonymous”,) claim this is a “public execution of Polytron and Phil Fish” that is being done in “retaliation for his attempted coverup of five guys burgers and fries.”</p> <p>Yep, you couldn’t make this up.</p> <p>The pastebin file includes passwords for various different email accounts of Phil’s, including various business accounts related to Polytron Corp., the company’s PayPal, and the various administrative email accounts.</p> <p>Fish, who is known for his volatile personality took to his twitter with a surprisingly deep and heartfelt series of tweets that show the true nature of the gaming industry:</p> <p>(tweets have been copied/pasted below, as Fish’s twitter account is private.)</p> <blockquote> <p><span>“this is videogames.</span></p> <p><span>this is what i get</span></p> <p><span>this is unacceptable</span></p> <p><span>this is not okay</span></p> <p><span>terrorist</span></p> <p><span>never again, you hear me? never again.</span></p> <p><span>this is videogames</span></p> <p><span>this is your audience</span></p> <p><span>to every aspiring game developer out there: don’t. give up. it’s not worth it.</span></p> <p><span>nothing is worth this.</span></p> <p><span>give up on your dreams. they are actually nightmares.</span></p> <p><span>just don’t do it.</span></p> <p>R<span>UN AWAY”</span></p> </blockquote> <p>Fish finally told the world he was done, announcing that “<span>POLYTRON and the FEZ IP are now for sale. no reasonable offer will be turned down. i am done. i want out.”</span></p> <p>While it is unclear whether or not Phil is serious in this, the tweets are extremely disheartening.</p> <p>Fish finally ended his deluge of tweets and deleted his twitter. “never again.” he tells the world.</p> <p>Tonight’s turn of events are extremely sad. While many gamers go far to show that we are all family here in the industry, driving a true visionary and artistic genius like Phil Fish from the business simply because you don’t like their personality is stupid, childish, and overall shows a total lack maturity throughout the industry. It’s disgusting, to say the least.<br> </p> </div> <div class="post-share"> <p>SHARE THIS POST</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://levelsave.com/feed/" title="Subscribe to our feed"><img src="http://levelsave.com/wp-content/themes/leetpress/images/rss-big.png" alt=""></a></li> <li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://levelsave.com/phil-fish-polytron-doxxed-phil-fish-quits-gaming-sells-fez-polytron/?t=Phil%20Fish%20&amp;%20Polytron%20doxxed%20by%204chan%E2%80%99s%20/v/,%20Fez%20&amp;%20Polytron%20up%20for%20sale" title="Post to Facebook"><img src="http://levelsave.com/wp-content/themes/leetpress/images/facebook-big.png" alt="Facebook"></a></li> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=Phil%20Fish%20&amp;%20Polytron%20doxxed%20by%204chan%E2%80%99s%20/v/,%20Fez%20&amp;%20Polytron%20up%20for%20sale%C2%A0-%C2%A0http://levelsave.com/phil-fish-polytron-doxxed-phil-fish-quits-gaming-sells-fez-polytron/" title="Post to Twitter"><img src="http://levelsave.com/wp-content/themes/leetpress/images/twitter-big.png" alt="Twitter"></a></li> <li><a href="http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&amp;t=Phil%20Fish%20&amp;%20Polytron%20doxxed%20by%204chan%E2%80%99s%20/v/,%20Fez%20&amp;%20Polytron%20up%20for%20sale&amp;c=Check%20this%20out&amp;u=http://levelsave.com/phil-fish-polytron-doxxed-phil-fish-quits-gaming-sells-fez-polytron/&amp;l=&gt;" title="Post to Myspace"><img src="http://levelsave.com/wp-content/themes/leetpress/images/myspace.png" alt="Myspace"></a></li> <li><a href="http://www.google.com/reader/link?title=Phil%20Fish%20&amp;%20Polytron%20doxxed%20by%204chan%E2%80%99s%20/v/,%20Fez%20&amp;%20Polytron%20up%20for%20sale&amp;url=http://levelsave.com/phil-fish-polytron-doxxed-phil-fish-quits-gaming-sells-fez-polytron/" title="Google Buzz"><img src="http://levelsave.com/wp-content/themes/leetpress/images/google.png" alt="Google Buzz"></a></li> <li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://levelsave.com/phil-fish-polytron-doxxed-phil-fish-quits-gaming-sells-fez-polytron/&amp;title=Phil%20Fish%20&amp;%20Polytron%20doxxed%20by%204chan%E2%80%99s%20/v/,%20Fez%20&amp;%20Polytron%20up%20for%20sale" title="Share on Reddit"><img src="http://levelsave.com/wp-content/themes/leetpress/images/reddit.png" alt="Reddit"></a></li> <li><a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http://levelsave.com/phil-fish-polytron-doxxed-phil-fish-quits-gaming-sells-fez-polytron/&amp;title=Phil%20Fish%20&amp;%20Polytron%20doxxed%20by%204chan%E2%80%99s%20/v/,%20Fez%20&amp;%20Polytron%20up%20for%20sale" title="Stumble this"><img src="http://levelsave.com/wp-content/themes/leetpress/images/stumbleupon.png" alt="Stumnleupon"></a></li> <li><a href="http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://levelsave.com/phil-fish-polytron-doxxed-phil-fish-quits-gaming-sells-fez-polytron/&amp;title=Phil%20Fish%20&amp;%20Polytron%20doxxed%20by%204chan%E2%80%99s%20/v/,%20Fez%20&amp;%20Polytron%20up%20for%20sale" title="Add To Delicious"><img src="http://levelsave.com/wp-content/themes/leetpress/images/delicious.png" alt="Delicious"></a></li> <li><a href="http://digg.com/submit?url=http://levelsave.com/phil-fish-polytron-doxxed-phil-fish-quits-gaming-sells-fez-polytron/&amp;title=Phil%20Fish%20&amp;%20Polytron%20doxxed%20by%204chan%E2%80%99s%20/v/,%20Fez%20&amp;%20Polytron%20up%20for%20sale&amp;thumbnails=1" title="Digg this!"><img src="http://levelsave.com/wp-content/themes/leetpress/images/digg.png" alt="Digg"></a></li> <li><a href="http://technorati.com/signup/?f=favorites&amp;Url=http://levelsave.com/phil-fish-polytron-doxxed-phil-fish-quits-gaming-sells-fez-polytron/" title="Post to Technorati"><img src="http://levelsave.com/wp-content/themes/leetpress/images/technorati.png" alt="Technorati"></a></li> <li class="email"><a href="mailto:?subject=Phil%20Fish%20&amp;%20Polytron%20doxxed%20by%204chan%E2%80%99s%20/v/,%20Fez%20&amp;%20Polytron%20up%20for%20sale&amp;body=http://levelsave.com/phil-fish-polytron-doxxed-phil-fish-quits-gaming-sells-fez-polytron/" title="Email a Friend"><img src="http://levelsave.com/wp-content/themes/leetpress/images/email.png" alt="Email"></a></li> </ul> </div> </div> </section>
